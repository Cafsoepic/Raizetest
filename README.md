# Dabber Image Host
Dabber Image Host is an open-source image host featuring encryption, embedding (in Discord and other social media), and Discord integration.

There is a live version of this software running [here](https://dabber-image.host/).

Feel free to fork this, host your own version, or whatever you want - this is open source, after all.

When running your own version, make sure to copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`, then fill it in however you want. Additionally, create a `keys.txt` file and fill it in with keys delimited by newlines in this format: ```
<key> [# <optional comment>]
```
